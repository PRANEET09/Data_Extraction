It can also be caused by a problem in the inner ear, where balance is regulated. \\nDizziness is often a result of vertigo as well. The most common cause of vertigo and vertigo-related dizziness is \\nbenign positional vertigo (BPV)\\n. This causes short-term dizziness when someone changes positions quickly, such as sitting up in bed after lying down. \\nDizziness and vertigo can also be triggered by \\nMeniere’s disease\\n. This causes fluid to build up in the ear with associated ear fullness, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Another possible cause for dizziness and vertigo is an acoustic neuroma. This is a noncancerous tumor that forms on the nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain. \\nSome other possible causes of dizziness include:\\nsudden drop in blood pressure\\nheart muscle disease\\ndecrease in blood volume\\nanxiety disorders\\nanemia\\n (low iron)\\nhypoglycemia\\n (low blood sugar)\\near infection \\ndehydration\\nheat stroke\\nexcessive exercise\\nmotion sickness\\nIn rare cases, dizziness could be caused by \\nmultiple sclerosis\\n, a stroke, a malignant tumor, or another brain disorder.',\n",
