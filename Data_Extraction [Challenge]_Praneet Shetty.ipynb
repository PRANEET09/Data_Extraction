It can also be caused by a problem in the inner ear, where balance is regulated. \\nDizziness is often a result of vertigo as well. The most common cause of vertigo and vertigo-related dizziness is \\nbenign positional vertigo (BPV)\\n. This causes short-term dizziness when someone changes positions quickly, such as sitting up in bed after lying down. \\nDizziness and vertigo can also be triggered by \\nMeniereâ€™s disease\\n. This causes fluid to build up in the ear with associated ear fullness, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Another possible cause for dizziness and vertigo is an acoustic neuroma. This is a noncancerous tumor that forms on the nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain. \\nSome other possible causes of dizziness include:\\nsudden drop in blood pressure\\nheart muscle disease\\ndecrease in blood volume\\nanxiety disorders\\nanemia\\n (low iron)\\nhypoglycemia\\n (low blood sugar)\\near infection \\ndehydration\\nheat stroke\\nexcessive exercise\\nmotion sickness\\nIn rare cases, dizziness could be caused by \\nmultiple sclerosis\\n, a stroke, a malignant tumor, or another brain disorder.',\n",
